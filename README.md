# YelpR8: Business Recommendations System

![Yelp Review Project Banner](./competition/docs/banner.png)


## Overview
YelpR8 is a hybrid recommendation system designed to predict user ratings for businesses on Yelp. This project leverages both model-based and item-based collaborative filtering approaches. The model-based component uses an XGBoost regressor with carefully engineered features extracted from Yelp data, while the item-based component computes Pearson similarities between businesses. Finally, a hybrid prediction is obtained by weighting the outputs of both methods. This integrated approach has allowed the system to achieve a competitive RMSE, placing it at rank 12 in the competition.

## Setup & Installation

### Environment Requirements
- **Python Version:** 3.6 (or later, ensuring compatibility with Spark 3.1.2)
- **Scala Version:** 2.12
- **JDK:** 1.8
- **Apache Spark:** 3.1.2 (using Spark RDDs – DataFrame and DataSet are not allowed)
- **External Libraries:**  
  - `xgboost`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `scikit-learn`

> The environment on Google Colab may differ slightly from a local setup, but there is no need to worry—it will still work as expected.

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:KayvanShah1/YelpR8-Business-Recommendations-System.git
   cd YelpR8-Business-Recommendations-System
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Create a virtual environment (optional) and install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
> I recommend using Google Colab for this project, as it provides a convenient and hassle-free environment for running the code without requiring extensive local setup.

## Approach and Intuition

The main objective of YelpR8 is to improve recommendation accuracy by combining two complementary approaches:

1. **Model-Based Recommendation:**
   - **Feature Engineering:**  
     Data from multiple sources (user profiles, business details, reviews, tips, and photos) is aggregated. For each user-business pair, we extract features like average star ratings, review counts, user activity metrics, and business characteristics.
   - **XGBoost Regression:**  
     After feature extraction, the system normalizes the data using a min–max scaler. The XGBoost regressor is trained with hyperparameters optimized through local GridSearch. This model is able to capture non-linear relationships in the data, resulting in robust rating predictions.

2. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
   - **Pearson Similarity:**  
     We compute the Pearson similarity between businesses by comparing the ratings provided by common users. For pairs with few co-ratings, a fallback similarity based on average ratings difference is used.
   - **Neighbour Selection:**  
     For each target prediction, ratings from the top 15 most similar businesses are aggregated (weighted by similarity) to predict the rating.
  
3. **Hybrid Approach:**
   - **Fusion of Predictions:**  
     The final prediction is a weighted combination of the model-based and item-based predictions. A carefully chosen weight (e.g., FACTOR = 0.05222) helps balance the strengths of both methods, leading to improved accuracy overall.

This dual approach leverages the robustness of model-based predictions with the personalized similarity insights from collaborative filtering, resulting in improved RMSE performance.

## Results

Below is a summary of the system's performance metrics on the validation and test datasets:

| Metric                          | Value (Validation) | Value (Test)    |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| **RMSE**                      | 0.9773             | 0.9760          |
| **Error Distribution (Count)**|                    |                 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;>= 0 and < 1        | 102,162            | (Similar trend) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;>= 1 and < 2        | 32,993             | (Similar trend) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;>= 2 and < 3        | 6,116              | (Similar trend) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;>= 3 and < 4        | 773                | (Similar trend) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;>= 4              | 0                  | 0               |
| **Data Processing Time**        | -                  | ~183.6 seconds  |
| **Model Training Time**         | -                  | ~425.0 seconds  |
| **Total Execution Time**        | -                  | ~622.1 seconds  |

*Note: The error distribution for the test set follows a similar pattern to the validation set. These metrics showcase that the system not only meets but slightly beats the TA’s RMSE threshold of 0.9800.*

> [!NOTE]
> Overall Rank: `12`

## Usage
### Command-Line Execution
The system is executed via Spark using the following command:
```sh
/opt/spark/spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop3.2/bin/spark-submit competition.py <folder_path> <test_file_name> <output_file_name>
```
- **folder_path:** Directory containing the Yelp datasets (e.g., `yelp_train.csv`, `review_train.json`, `user.json`, `business.json`, etc.)
- **test_file_name:** Path to the validation/test CSV file (e.g., `yelp_val.csv`)
- **output_file_name:** Desired output CSV file path for the predictions

### Example
```sh
spark-submit competition.py ./YelpData ./YelpData/yelp_val.csv ./Output/predictions.csv
```

## Future Work

- **Model Improvements:**  
  Experiment with additional ensemble methods or deep learning approaches to further improve prediction accuracy.
- **Real-Time Recommendations:**  
  Extend the system to support near real-time predictions using streaming data.
- **Additional Features:**  
  Incorporate more sophisticated feature engineering (e.g., text mining from reviews) and user personalization.
